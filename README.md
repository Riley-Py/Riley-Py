## Hi there 👋

My name is Riley and I am in my first year of engineering! I do many tech related endeavours, such as:

- ⚙️ Hardware - ESP32, Arduino, microcontrollers
- 💻 Software - Programs, websites
- 🐧 Linux - Customization, troubleshooting, research (hopefully in the future contribute to open source projects 🤞)
- ♟️ Chess - [Profile here](https://www.chess.com/member/riley2017)

Let's go on an adventure together 🥾!

# Welcome to The Tech Between! üëã

My name's Riley and I'm in my first year of engineering (as of writing)! I do many related endeavours, such as:

- ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware - ESP32, Arduino, microcontrollers
- üíª Software - Programs, websites
- üêß Linux - Customization, troubleshooting, research (hopefully in the future contribute to open source projects ü§û)
- ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess - [Profile here](https://www.chess.com/member/riley2017)

Let's go on an adventure together ü•æ! Click on the "Project" badges below each project to see the Github repo!

# About üå±

I got my start in tech when I was pretty young, but didn't get too serious about it until 2019-2020.  That was when I learned my first programming language, Python, and installed my first GNU/Linux operating system, Ubuntu.  I made a simple Grade Calculator in Python, where it would compute the mean, median, mode, and range for the grades.  Then, after making some projects with Python and exploring BASH with Ubuntu, I moved on to C++/C# as I took computer engineering and computer science, respectively.  As well, after some derivatives of Debian (POP_OS) and Arch (Endeavour_OS), I landed on GNOME/Arch in late 2022-early 2023. In computer engineering, I used C++ to program Arduino microcontrollers, culminating in a [security alarm system](https://github.com/Riley-Py/Security-Alarm-System) and an ESP 32 project aforementioned above.  In computer science, I used C# in tandem with Winforms, culminating in a [brick breaker program](https://github.com/Riley-Py/ICS3UFinalProjectBreakout).  As well, I would use C++ for a robotics competition called "VEX Robotics", aforementioned above.  After some customization with GNOME/Arch, in 2024, I wanted a distro where it would have awesome workflow capabilities and have less bloat in terms of apps with GNOME.  I would eventually stumble upon dynamic tiling window managers, specifically Hyprland and its simple, yet effective, customization configuration.  That is where I'm at today, with a Hyprland/Arch combination for my main computer.  As well, as I am writing this, here are a few projects I want to work on:

- [ ] Redo website in React/Tailwind - IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Make a personal security camera - IDEATION STAGE
- [ ] Customize skateboard - IDEATION/DESIGN STAGE

---

Well, here we are at the end...I hope that this shows that anyone can have pretty diverse experiences in life and not one person is the same.  So long üëã!
